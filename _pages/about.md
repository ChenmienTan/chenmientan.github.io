I am a (unqualified) programmer affiliated with Alibaba Group.
I obtained M.Res. in Informatics at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of prof. [Shay Cohen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/).
Prior to that, I interned at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Dr. [Jie Fu](https://bigaidream.github.io/).
My interest lies in training agentic, particularly DeepResearch, large language models (LLMs) by reinforcement learning (RL).
I lead the development of [RL2](https://github.com/ChenmienTan/RL2).

## Acknowledgement

I am lucky to work with many enthusiastic, intelligent, and hardworking peers, such as [Yijun Yang](https://thomasyyj.github.io/yangyijun/)@Edinburgh, [Weipeng Zhang](https://github.com/Wp-Zhang)@Huawei, Jiahong Xie@SJTU, [Xun Zhao](https://github.com/CarnoZhao)@UCAS, Shengda Fan@RUC, [Ge Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qyTrq4kAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)@ByteDance, [Hanxu Hu](https://hanxuhu.github.io)@UZH, and [Simon Yu](https://simon-yu.netlify.app)@NEU.
I learnt a lot from them.
Foremost, I thank [Chenxi Chen](https://2023.rca.ac.uk/students/chenxi-chen/) for her companionship.
She is my greatest fortunate.
