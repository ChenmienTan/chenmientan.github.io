I am an algorithm engineer in Alibaba Group.
I obtained M.Res. in Informatics at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of prof. [Shay Cohen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/).
Prior to that, I interned at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Dr. [Jie Fu](https://bigaidream.github.io/).
Before that, I obtained B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China.
